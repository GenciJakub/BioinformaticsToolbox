Program gave us these results for hemoglobin:

There are 75 surface residues and 21 out of them are polar.
There are 66 buried residues and 9 out of them are polar.

These results were obtained for the A2a receptor:

There are 146 surface residues and 39 out of them are polar.
There are 163 buried residues and 44 out of them are polar.

We can clearly see, that A2a receptor is bigger and probably more globular than hemoglobin. Big difference is the portion of buried polar
amino acids, but we can see that more than quarter of them (in the A2a receptor) are CYS residues which create disulfidic bonds and
stabilize the protein. Big difference is also between buried GLN (polar) and ILE (non-polar) residues. Both of them may be scarce 
in the A2a receptor due to more "dense" core - less space for long and branching side chains.

Note: when trying to run the program on hemoglobin, it crashes because for some reason BioJava library takes hetatm record with res ID 1
as a normal atom and because of that has more residues than my own representation.
